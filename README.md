# VBA-Challenge

In this exercise, I created a VBA script to loop through three excel sheets each with over 700k entries of stock data.

The primary functions of this VBA script were to:
    1. Use the ticker symbol to summarize yearly change in price and traded volume
    2. Format the cells using VBA instead of using formatting options inside excel
    3. Get a feel for loops in VBA, extending to looping through multiple worksheets as opposed to just the active one.
